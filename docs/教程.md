# Tutorial

We can deploy multiple containers using Docker. Let's start with the minimum required container setup.

In the `./docker-compose.yml` file, you can find the configuration for the `opensearch` service.

Next, navigate to the `blog/src/main/resources/application.yml` file. Locate the `search.mode` setting and configure it to either `opensearch` or `mysql`. For a minimal setup, set it to `mysql`.

By default, these configurations are pre-defined for you.

```
brew install openjdk@17
java -version
echo 'export PATH="/opt/homebrew/opt/openjdk@17/bin:$PATH"' >> ~/.zshrc
echo 'export JAVA_HOME="/opt/homebrew/opt/openjdk@17/libexec/openjdk.jdk/Contents/Home"' >> ~/.zshrc
echo 'export CPPFLAGS="-I/opt/homebrew/opt/openjdk@17/include"' >> ~/.zshrc
source ~/.zshrc
brew install maven
mvn -v

```

## introduction

### environment

- mysql
- redis
- search
  - opensearch
  - elasticsearch

- zendesk/maxwell
- rabbitMQ
- maven
- java-openjdk

### install docker

you can find how to install docker from the internet.

### docker run

To begin, execute the [start.sh](./start.sh) script. This will pull the required Docker images. Please allow a few minutes for the process to complete.

If your platform is `linux` or `macos`, use the following commands:

```shell
chmod +x ./start.sh
./start.sh
```

### get jar file

we maybe wait for ten mintures to get `./app.jar`
